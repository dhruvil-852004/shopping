My name is Dhruvil Desai, and I love shopping online. I prefer mobile phone apps, but sometimes I use my computer. The phone is more convenient for me, and I can even do my shopping from bed!

I love shopping so much that I buy everything I need at home. I get food, electronics, books, and even large pieces of furniture like my sofa and bookshelves all online! But I still prefer getting clothes from a store so I can try them on to be sure they fit me fine.

Yesterday, I bought a birthday present for my mother, and it arrived today! That saves me a lot of time. I am a very busy person, and I am a little forgetful too. If I think of something I need, then it is wonderful that I can buy it at that moment.
